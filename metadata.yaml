description: This swashbuckling romance follows the fortunes of Miss Charlotte Durand,
  a Confederate patriot. She falls in love with and marries Captain Oliver only to
  learn, much to her surprise, that Captain Oliver is not the Confederate officer
  she believed him to be, but, rather, a Yankee spy. The Cavalier was later adapted
  for the stage.
